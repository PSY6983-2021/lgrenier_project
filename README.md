# lgrenier_project

My name is Laurence, but let's call me Lalou! 

I am a master student in psychology at Montreal University. I am particularly interested in social neurosciences, thereby working at the NeSC (Neuroscience en contextes sociaux)lab. My master project is a coordinate based meta-analysis on social hierarchy. Using the ALE algorithm, the main objective is to provide an overview of neural correlates underlying social hierarchy treatment. 

I really wish to contribute to science findings by adopting approaches that consider the current issues of reproductibility and social inclusion!
